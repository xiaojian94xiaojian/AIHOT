// A company's chronicle band: curated history from industry/chronicles/{slug}.json (optional) up to the
// month it is curated through, then the milestones the site picked up itself. Written before the code,
// from the ways it can go wrong:
// - a file with an impossible date, an unknown kind, two links, a plain-http link, an event after the
//   month it claims to cover, another topic's name or a topic that is not a company gets served;
// - the band repeats a month the curated history covers, or loses one after it;
// - it is not in time order (a year-only date belongs before that year's months), or links go to
//   the wrong place (an event page, an article page, the original outside the site); a curated title
//   is rewritten, or a picked-up milestone shows the news headline instead of its label;
// - a milestone the site picked up is set in bold (only the curated history marks defining events), or
//   loses its kind;
// - a company without a curated history has no band;
// - a curated file in the repository does not follow the format (the curators' guard).
